# Synth
Decided to play around with sound synthesis. Specifically Fourier sound synthesis, meaning that all sounds are directly created as sums of sin waves (literally).

This project was expanded to begin supporting envelopes, but much work can still be done.

See the examples folder for examples of what this synthesizer can create.
